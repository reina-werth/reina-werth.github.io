                    I work for Follett Content Solutions, a library book vendor. I am in the finance department, but I am working on getting my Master's in Library and Information Science so I can move into our cataloging and MARC customizations department. While in the MLIS program, I realized I had always been interested in information management and technology. I grew up in a tech-savvy household, where my father supervises a tech support team and always introduces newer technologies into our lifestyles. In my downtime, I have a passion for reading and watching movies or shows. Mainly anything horror, thriller, true-crime, mystery, or anything in between these genres is what I look for in particular.

                    I work with the End User Computing Team of UW-Madison's Library Technology group as a Student Supervisor and in other various IT capacities. My work within the libraries inspired me to seek out my MLIS, which I am currently taking classes for. I am extremely passionate about accessibility of information, especially when it comes to technology. I am also a theater nerd, and work with a local professional theater company, Forward Theater (Check them out <a href="https://forwardtheater.com/">here</a>) as their Wardrobe Supervisor. In my spare time, I play TTRPGs (Tabletop Roll Playing Games) like Dungeons and Dragons, and Fabula Ultima.
